## 1. Project Overview
The Poisonous Plant Identification System is designed to help users identify and differentiate between poisonous and non-poisonous plants. The Poisonous Plant Identification System's main objective is to identify unsafe plants in order to lower the number of fatalities or injuries as a result of plant poisoning. The system uses machine learning algorithms trained on extensive datasets to classify plant images and provide users with accurate information regarding their toxicity. This approach aims to improve public safety and awareness by giving people a fast and dependable way to identify potentially poisonous plants by utilising machine learning technology.

### Main Features
- **Image Classification**: Automatically classify plant images as poisonous or non-poisonous.
- **Toxicity Information**: Provide detailed toxicity profiles and symptoms associated with poisonous plants.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and receiving identification results.
- **Educational Resources**: Include educational content on poisonous plants and safety precautions.

## 3. Usage Guidelines

### For Users
 **Identify Plants**:
   - Open the mobile app and navigate to the plant identification feature
   - Use the camera to take a picture of the plant or select an image from your gallery
   - Click the "Identify" button
   - The system will process the image and display the plantâ€™s name and toxicity information
   - Results will load after 10-20 seconds
   - Results show the corresponding Poisonous Plants and their details including Toxicity Information. 
 **View Plant Information**:
   - After identifying a plant, the app provides detailed information about the plant, including its common name, scientific name, toxicity level, and safety measures
   - There is also a gallery of Poisonous Plants identified with user-friendly interactions
